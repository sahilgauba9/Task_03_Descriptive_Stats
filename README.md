<h1> Task_03_Descriptive_Stats </h1>

This project examines social media data from the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election through descriptive statistical analysis using three different techniques. The goal is to understand how performance, readability, and ease of use vary across methods.

<h2> Approaches compared:</h2>
* Core Python – using only built-in libraries 
* Pandas – the go-to data analysis toolkit 
* Polars – a fast, modern DataFrame library

<h2> Repository Contents </h2>
pure_python_stats.ipynb -	Implementation using only standard Python functions

pandas_stats.ipynb -	Descriptive analysis built with Pandas

polars_stats.ipynb - 	Analysis using the Polars library for performance comparison

no datasets are included in this repository.

To run the notebooks, download the .csv datasets separately and place them in your preferred local directory.


<h2> Getting Started: </h2>

Install Python 3.8+.

For Pandas and Polars notebooks, install the necessary packages:

pip install pandas polars


<h2> Purpose & Comparison </h2>

The analysis aims to reproduce identical descriptive statistics using three distinct methods, allowing a side-by-side evaluation of their usability and efficiency.

<h2> Findings: </h2>

Pandas stood out for its simplicity and rich functionality—ideal for most analysts.

Polars outperformed others in terms of speed, especially with larger datasets.

Pure Python achieved similar outcomes but required considerably more manual effort and computation time.


<h2> Take on AI Tools: </h2>
Modern AI assistants, including ChatGPT, often suggest Pandas-based solutions—and rightly so. Pandas offers a powerful balance of readability, flexibility, and performance, making it the most practical choice for day-to-day data analysis.
